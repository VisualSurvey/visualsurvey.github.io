abstract = {We present a novel method for the measurement of the similarity between aggregates of scanpaths. This may be thought of as a solution to the "average scanpath" problem. As a by-product of this method, we derive a classifier for groups of scanpaths drawn from various classes. This capability is empirically demonstrated using data gathered from an experiment in an attempt to automatically determine expert/novice classification for a set of visual tasks.},

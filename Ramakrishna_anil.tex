abstract="Exploratory data analysis can be used to uncover several hidden but interesting patterns that may not be obvious otherwise. Spatio-temporal data offer numerous challenges for such analyses and several approaches have been proposed to address them. In this paper, we present an interactive web based system that can visualize large spatio-temporal data set on a standard web browser. This approach is applied to visualize a large spatio-temporal data set with 2.5 million records and several key patterns of the data are revealed in this process.",

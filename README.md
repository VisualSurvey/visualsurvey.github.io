I have worked on the development of a website for Data Visualization Survey results. The idea behind the website is that various research papers related to Data Visualization would be showcased in an interactive manner for the end user along with the presence of several filters upon selection of which would update the search results accordingly on the website. Each visualization technique would be displayed in the form of an image and on click of each image, a modal box would pop up displaying different details related to the paper such as the: Author name, Year Published, Paper Title, Citation, the BibTex etc. Also, there is a filter panel where multiple filter combinations could be selected related to visualization techniques. The selection/ deselection of these filters would update the search results accordingly. There is a search box implemented as well, where the user can enter text and search for different papers. The count of papers displayed is dynamic and updates immediately based on results displayed on the webpage. For this project, I have used JavaScript, HTML and CSS along with some JavaScript libraries such as Bootstrap, jQuery and Ajax which are used for implementing the dynamic features in the webpage.

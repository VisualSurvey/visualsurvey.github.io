# visualsurvey.github.io

I worked on the development of a website for data visualization survey results as part of my M.S. project. The idea behind the website is that research papers related to data visualization are displayed in an interactive manner along with several filters that allow the user to restrict search results. Each visualization technique is displayed in the form of an image. When the image is clicked, a modal box pops up displaying details related to the paper, including author name, year published, paper title, citation, and BibTeX entry. Also, there is a filter panel where multiple filter combinations can be selected related to visualization techniques. The selection/deselection of these filters updates the search results accordingly. A search box is also provided, allowing the user to enter text and search for matching papers. The count of papers displayed is dynamic and updates immediately based on results displayed on the webpage. For this project, I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS along with JavaScript libraries such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and Ajax, which are used for implementing the webpage's dynamic features.

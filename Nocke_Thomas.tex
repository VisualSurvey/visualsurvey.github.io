AB  - Increasing amounts of large climate data require new analysis techniques. The area of data mining investigates new paradigms and methods including factors like scalability, flexibility and problem abstraction for large data sets. The field of visual data mining in particular offers valuable methods for analyzing large amounts of data intuitively. In this paper we describe our approach of integrating cluster analysis and visualization methods for the exploration of climate data. We integrated cluster algorithms, appropriate visualization techniques and sophisticated interaction paradigms into a general framework.
